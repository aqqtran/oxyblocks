# Welcome!
Here, you’ll find everything you need to get started with the design set, including how it works, what plugins you’ll need and everything you need to know about the OxyBlocks Framework! If you've recently picked up a design set, let's [get you started]()!

## What is OxyBlocks?
OxyBlocks is a collection of design sets for Oxygen Builder built on a custom framework with responsiveness and accessibility in mind! OxyBlocks utilises a custom CSS framework that integrates seamlessly with Oxygen. You can learn more about it [here](framework.md).

## Requirements
- OxyBlocks are design sets made for [Oxygen Builder](https://oxygenbuilder.com/).
- To be able to use OxyBlocks on your site, you need the [Asura Connector](https://wordpress.org/plugins/asura-connector/).

The Asura Connector plugin has a few system requirements. Of course, all of these requirements are satisfied by the modern hosting, so it's highly recommended that you use modern hosting to run the Asura Connector plugin.
You will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:
- PHP 7.4+
- WordPress 5.5+
